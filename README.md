# Make-your-research-life-easier (Computer vision& Imaging)
A collection of links and resources helpful to our research life. I am [Guangyuan Zhao](https://zhaoguangyuan123.github.io/), and I am currently working perception and decision intelligence. Feel free to email to zhaoguangyuan2021@gmail.com or draft in the issues if you have any thoughts.

**Note:** Oftentimes, I find not all the researchers have same privilege to have great advisors to foster their research taste and mindset. I would love to format and share some of my own learnings here.

## How to write papers, thesis, etc.?
> We sometimes get reviewers' comments saying that the writing is poor. The cause of such comment is not all about our English. Often, the comments relate more to our "mindset" of writing. The ability of communicating our research clearly, directly and efficiently to the audience is crucial in technical writeups.

## How to review paper
> I personally would say: novelty should consider **Knowledge Advancement**. An interesting or superising paper usually advance knowledge on solving certain problem or even the definiation of new problem.
