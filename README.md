# Make-your-research-life-easier (Computer vision& Imaging)
A collection of links and resources helpful to our research life. I am [Guangyuan Zhao](https://zhaoguangyuan123.github.io/), and I am currently working perception and decision intelligence. Feel free to email to zhaoguangyuan2021@gmail.com or draft in the [issues](https://github.com/zhaoguangyuan123/make-your-research-life-easier/issues) if you have any thoughts.

> **Note:** Oftentimes, I find not all the researchers have same privilege to have great resources to foster their research taste and mindset. I would love to format and share some of my own learnings here.
**Note+:** I personally love reading blogs&websites from [Fredo Durand](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/), [Yisong Yue](https://yisongyue.medium.com/) and [Bill Freeman](https://billf.mit.edu/) etc, and find myself learn a lot from those readings. For some notes, I have read them multiple times and remember every single sentence. I am also inspired by those pioneers and will share my own learnings & thoughts here.

## How to develop a good research taste and mindset?
> "What is most important problem in your field? Why are you not working on it?" - Richard Hamming
> \- I can bet that *most* researchers cannot even answer the 1st question.

## How to write papers, thesis, etc.?
> We sometimes get reviewers' comments saying that the writing is poor. The cause of such comment is not all about our English. Often, the comments relate more to our "mindset" of writing. The ability of communicating our research clearly, directly and efficiently to the audience is crucial in technical writeups.
